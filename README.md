# Python Refresh Projects

This repository is a collection of small Python projects I’m building while refreshing my Python basics and gradually improving my skills.

I’m following the Python roadmap from **roadmap.sh** and using projects instead of just rereading theory. The idea is to relearn concepts properly and apply them right away.

---

## What this repo is about

* Refreshing Python fundamentals
* Practicing by building small, focused projects
* Filling gaps in my understanding
* Getting more comfortable writing clean Python code

These projects are not meant to be perfect or complex. They’re part of the learning process.

---

## Topics I’m revisiting

Depending on the project, this repo may cover:

* Basic syntax and logic
* Conditions and loops
* Functions
* Lists, dictionaries, sets, and tuples
* File handling
* Context managers (`with`)
* Modules and imports

---

## Project structure

Each folder inside this repository is a separate mini project.

```
python-refresh-projects/
│
├── project_1/
│   └── main.py
│
├── project_2/
│   └── main.py
│
└── README.md
```

Some projects may include extra files if needed.

## Notes

This repo represents learning in progress.

* Some code may be messy at first
* Projects may be improved or rewritten later
* Simplicity comes before optimization

That’s intentional.
